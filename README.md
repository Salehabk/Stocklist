Welcome to my API Project for QA! (for a second time because it somehow got deleted!) Git has now deleted my project again 
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS This API has been designed for a QA Bootcamp final project. How I expected the challenge to go? Being newly introduced to coding, this challenge seemed very terrifying but I have learnt a lot. What went Well? Utilised crud functionality in my api and successfully connected to a database. What didnt go as planned? Many errors, deleted files, corrupted files, and a deleted readME.
IMPROVEMENTS time management, planning and getting more acquainted with the coding concepts.



PLEASE NOTE: DUE TO UNFORSEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, GIT HAS DELETED MY UPDATED PROJECT WHICH WAS READY AND AVAILABLE TO SEE IN THE VIDEO PRESENTATION. STRAIGHT AFTER, A PUSH REQUEST WAS PUT FORTH AND EVERYTHING HAS BEEN CHANGED. TEST FILES ARE NOW UNAVAILABLE THERE.
TO VIEW THE PROJECT, PLEASE REFER TO THE DEV BRANCH AS I HAVE NO TIME TO AMEND THIS ISSUE.
