Welcome to my API Project for QA! (for a second time because it somehow got deleted!) Git has now deleted my project again 
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS This API has been designed for a QA Bootcamp final project. How I expected the challenge to go? Being newly introduced to coding, this challenge seemed very terrifying but I have learnt a lot. What went Well? Utilised crud functionality in my api and successfully connected to a database. What didnt go as planned? Many errors, deleted files, corrupted files, and a deleted readME.
IMPROVEMENTS time management, planning and getting more acquainted with the coding concepts.
